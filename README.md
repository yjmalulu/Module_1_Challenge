## Overview and Origin

Coinbase is a digital platform for trading and storing cryptocurrencies. It makes money via transaction fees, subscriptions, commissions earned on custodial funds, and interests earned on these. Coinbase took its name from the content of the “input” of a generation transaction that has no parent transaction outputs, and it is called “coinbase.” In simple words, it’s the first transaction of a new block.

Coinbase is building the cryptoeconomy – a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto. The company started in 2012 with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin. Today, Coinbase offers a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader cryptoeconomy.

Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer. While at Airbnb, he saw the difficulties of sending money to South America. He began working weekends and nights to write code in Ruby and JavaScript to buy and store cryptocoins. Armstrong applied for Y Combinator incubation but was told to find a co-founder to proceed and had only three days to find one. He posted on Hacker News for a co-founder explaining his mission, which went viral and garnered massive interest on Reddit as well. This is when Armstrong met Ehrsam, a Goldman Sachs trader. The duo joined hands and obtained a $150,000 funding infusion from the startup incubator program at Y Combinator. 

Armstrong and Ehram started raising funds to build Coinbase and, in May 2013, raised a $5 million Series A investment from New-York based venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, with Fred Wilson serving as the lead investor. Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, is well known for his earlier investments in successful companies including Twitter, Tumblr, Zynga, Foursquare, Etsy and more. 

In December 2013, Coinbase raised another $25 million from Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital and other investors. Presently, Coinbase has 76 investors and has raised a total of $498.7 million in funding over 18 rounds. Ehrsam left the company in 2017 with a 6% stake but still serves on the board of directors and was part of the company’s audit committee before its April 2021 public offering.

On April 14, 2021, Coinbase went public via a direct stock listing and was listed on the NASDAQ as COIN. Coinbase opened at $381 per share, valuing the company at $99.6 billion, and briefly touched a market capitalization of $100 billion, which was 10 times higher than Coinbase’s last private valuation. The valuation rivaled the likes of Facebook and Airbnb when they went public.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
It is electronic money that gets stored in e-wallets or computer files. Plus, it can be transferred and tracked using blockchain technology. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The crypto space is bustling with newfound interest. It has become more popular globally. However, since cryptocurrencies are still the new kid on the block, there is much to unravel and learn about them.
DEFI (decentralized fiance)   DeFi applications, offer a range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and investing. These services are facilitated by smart contracts, which automate the process of borrowing and lending money.
NFT (non-fungible tokens)NFTs are digital assets representing ownership of a unique item or piece of content, such as artwork, music, or even tweets. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible (meaning that they can be exchanged for one another), NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged for another asset on a one-to-one basis.
STABLECOINS Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a traditional asset such as the US dollar or gold. They offer the benefits of cryptocurrencies, such as fast and borderless transactions, but without the volatility that comes with other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.
CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCIES (CBDCS) CBDCs are also an integral part of trends in cryptocurrency. They are designed to offer the same advantages as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with the added benefit of being backed by a government or central bank. This makes them more stable and less volatile than other cryptocurrencies and could make them a more attractive option for businesses and consumers.

3. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
4. Grayscale
5. OpenSea
6. Sandbox

* How is your company performing relative to competiters in the same domain?
Binance is currently the world’s largest exchange in terms of the daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies. It is indeed Coinbase’s direct competitor both in terms of trading volumes and market capitalization. 
Binance has earned a reputation as an exchange that sometimes has carried out some business activities before asking for permission, which has caused further regulatory issues. Acting without too many restrictions certainly favors more rapid innovation, which the exchange has shown over time and other platforms. However, it has also caused closer scrutiny from authorities. 
The U.S.-based platform was the first mainstream Bitcoin exchange, founded by former Airbnb engineer Brian Armstrong and former Goldman Sachs trader Fred Ehrsam. It launched in the United States in June 2012, three years after the Bitcoin white paper became known worldwide. 
At first, Bitcoin was the only existing cryptocurrency traded on the platform, and for the first time, it was available for purchase via bank transfers. 
In April 2021, Coinbase Global became the first cryptocurrency company to go public on the Nasdaq exchange via a direct listing (investments offered directly to the public with no brokers involved). Coinbase has primarily succeeded in staying on the right path on the regulatory side.
The crypto world has come to terms with security issues that have rightly distraught users in the past. The multiple security hacks that occurred over the years, though, have encouraged exchanges to deliver enhanced security features that grant more reliability nowadays. 

Despite that, leaving assets on exchanges is still not thoroughly recommended, and users should be aware of the possible risks that such action might bring. Coinbase appears more secure, considering it never had significant attacks since its inception.

On the other hand, in 2019, Binance suffered a significant hack, with as many as 7000 Bitcoin stolen from the exchange. Binance has since taken rigorous measures to increase all security standards following the painful episode. 

Binance and Coinbase offer robust security features to protect users’ digital assets. However, Coinbase appears more transparent about its steps to keep customers’ funds safe.
  
## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be someting that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Fees. Coinbase has a lot of ways you can pay for crypto, and they can carry different fees that are at times hard to understand. While Coinbase discloses fees to users before completing a transaction, they are difficult to look up ahead of time. This can make life difficult for people who are choosing an exchange for the first time and who are sensitive to fees. And overall, some competitors do charge less. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or sevice would benefit the company?
